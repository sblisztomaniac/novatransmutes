<ul>
<li><p><strong>Surrender</strong></p>
<p>  Life unfolds in its own rhythm, guided by a force far greater than what the mind can grasp. The path to peace lies not in controlling this force, but in surrendering to it — trusting that it knows exactly what it's doing.</p>
<p>  When you let go of the constant need to shape life according to your desires, the struggle begins to fade. The energy within you naturally knows how to heal, guide, and carry you forward.</p>
<p>  This surrender is not about helplessness — it's about balance. Like a sailor adjusting to the wind, you move from one balance point to the next, trusting that you are exactly where you need to be.</p>

<p><strong>The Surrender Experiment</strong></p>
<p>  The core message of <strong>The Surrender Experiment</strong> is about letting go of personal resistance and trusting the natural flow of life.</p>
<p>  Key takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ <strong>Surrender your need to control</strong></li>
<li>✅ <strong>Trust that life knows what it's doing</strong></li>
<li>✅ <strong>Offer your best without attachment</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Living Untethered</strong></p>
<p>  In <strong>Living Untethered</strong>, Singer teaches that true love flows freely from within, meaningful relationships expect nothing in return, and inner peace comes through letting go.</p>
<p>  Core principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Release the need for control</li>
<li>✅ Embrace reality as it is</li>
<li>✅ Trust in life's unfolding</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p><strong>The Untethered Soul</strong></p>
<p>  <strong>The Untethered Soul</strong> explores how inner peace comes from mastering your mind, heart, and energy flow.</p>
<p>  Key concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep your heart open, regardless of circumstances</li>
<li>Choose to relax through discomfort rather than resist it</li>
<li>Practice unconditional openness to life</li>
<li>Let go immediately when disturbances arise</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Core Teachings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Trust and Let Go</strong></p>
<p>  "You don't have to control every nerve cell — delegate the authority. As Lao Tzu said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'The great Tao flows everywhere, both to the left and to the right. It loves and nourishes all things but does not lord it over them. When merits are accomplished, it lays no claim to them.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  Relinquishing control and trusting the process paradoxically makes you more powerful. Just as you trust your nervous system to wake you up, you can trust life to unfold beautifully. The key to unity with the universe is not control — it's trust.</p>

<p><strong>Living in the Present</strong></p>
<p>  The real Self exists for no purpose; it simply <em>is</em>. It doesn't chase the future or cling to the past — it resides in the eternal now. The more you try to make this realization 'useful,' the more elusive it becomes.</p>
<p>  True play is done for no reason — just for fun. Justifying play as 'exercise' or 'good for you' misses its essence. Let go and simply enjoy.</p>
<p>  ➡️ <a href="https://alanwatts.org/2-4-8-way-beyond-seeking-part-1/">Way Beyond Seeking - Part 1</a></p>
<li><p><strong>Living Authentically</strong></p>
<p>  If you believe earning money is the most important thing, you risk wasting your life doing what you dislike — just to keep doing things you dislike.</p>
<p>  Human activity often tries to make fleeting joys permanent, yet life's beauty lies in its ever-changing nature. Seeking perfect security in a fluid universe is a contradiction.</p>
<p>  ➡️ <a href="https://youtu.be/7blUYJm6i-c">The Gold Essence - Alan Watts</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>On Joy and Peace</strong></p>
<p>  The secret to enjoying pleasure lies in embracing it without force or fear.</p>
<p>  ➡️ <a href="https://alanwatts.org/1-3-10-religion-and-sexuality-pt-1/?highlight=Sex">Religion and Sexuality - Pt 1 (Last Paragraph)</a></p>
<p>  No amount of effort can turn turmoil into peace.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Essential Quotes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On Life and Existence</strong><ul>
<li><em>"The secret of the mastery of life is to know when to stop."</em></li>
<li><em>"You and I are all as much continuous with the physical universe as a wave is continuous with the ocean."</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>On Wisdom</strong><ul>
<li><em>"A person may appear a fool and yet not be one. He may only be guarding his wisdom carefully."</em></li>
<li><em>"You're under no obligation to be the same person you were 5 minutes ago."</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>On Living Purposefully</strong><ul>
<li><em>"Paradoxical as it may seem, the purposeful life has no content, no point. It hurries on and on, and misses everything. Not hurrying, the purposeless life misses nothing, for it is only when there is no goal and no rush that the human senses are fully open to receive the world."</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>On Spirituality</strong><ul>
<li><em>"Zen does not confuse spirituality with thinking about God while one is peeling potatoes. Zen spirituality is just to peel the potatoes."</em></li>
<li><em>"If we cling to belief in God, we cannot likewise have faith, since faith is not clinging but letting go."</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>On Self and Society</strong><ul>
<li><em>"What I am really saying is that you don't need to do anything because if you see yourself in the correct way, you are all as much an extraordinary phenomenon of nature as trees, clouds, the patterns in running water, the flickering of fire, the arrangement of the stars, and the form of a galaxy. You are all just like that, and there is nothing wrong with you at all."</em></li>

<p>Introduction to Taoism</p>
<p>  <strong>The Lesson of the Hand Pump</strong></p>
<p>  Between the days of lowering a bucket into a well and the modern electric water pump, there was the hand pump. The hand pump was usually made from cast iron, and you had to pump a handle up and down to get water out of the well.</p>
<p>  The problem with the hand pump was that it had to be <strong>"primed"</strong> to make it work. Priming involved pouring a little water on the pump to create a seal. Once it was sealed, it was easy to pump up much more water. If you didn't have water in your priming bucket, you had to borrow some from a neighbor.</p>
<p>  It took water to get water. A simple lesson.</p>
<p>  <strong>Taoism functions the same way.</strong></p>
<p>  You have to <strong>prime the pump</strong>. You need some spiritual wisdom to get you going.</p>

<p>Managing Life with Taoist Principles</p>
<h3 id=" core-principles-"><strong>Core Principles</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Managing Resources</strong></li>fAla
<li><strong>Managing Relationships</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-Development</strong></li>
<li><p><strong>Self-Maintenance</strong></p>
<p>A Taoist lifestyle includes:</p>
</li>
<li><p>A large surplus of <strong>qi</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Activities like <strong>sleep</strong> to reduce energy costs and restore energy</li>
<li>Consuming <strong>high-energy foods</strong></li>
<li>A routine with <strong>exercise</strong></li>
<li>Physical care that circulates qi</li>
<li><p>Insulation from <strong>outside stressors</strong></p>
<p>For thousands of years, Taoists have designed tools to restore your body, mind, and qi. That's why practices like <strong>kung fu</strong>, <strong>qi gong</strong>, and various <strong>health practices</strong> exist — to undo the reckless expenditure of energy during youth.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li><p>Living in the Present</p>
<p>  In our modern world, we often believe there's always another door. Social mind builds around this thought.</p>
<p>  However, Taoism teaches that the only thing we can truly do is walk through the <strong>present door</strong> with confidence, knowing the next door will appear as we move forward.</p>
<p>  Many wait for a "big door" that guarantees instant happiness — but this is rare. The real journey lies in passing through one door at a time.</p>
<p>  Taoism doesn't simply confirm your prejudices; instead, it demands you build a <strong>direct link</strong> with the Tao itself and learn from it.</p>

<li><p>Tao Te Ching Wisdom</p>
<p>  <strong>On Water's Power</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it;—for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  <strong>On Serving the World</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Who can take his own superabundance and therewith serve all under heaven? Only he who is in possession of the Tao!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  <strong>On Strength and Weakness</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Man at his birth is supple and weak; at his death, firm and strong. (So it is with) all things. Trees and plants, in their early growth, are soft and brittle; at their death, dry and withered."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  <strong>On the Way of Heaven</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is the way of Heaven not to strive, and yet it skilfully overcomes; not to speak, and yet it is skilful in obtaining a reply; does not call, and yet men come to it of themselves. Its demonstrations are quiet, and yet its plans are skilful and effective. The meshes of the net of Heaven are large; far apart, but letting nothing escape."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  <strong>On Finishing What You Start</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(But) people in their conduct of affairs are constantly ruining them when they are on the eve of success. If they were careful at the end, as (they should be) at the beginning, they would not so ruin them."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  <strong>On Preparation and Order</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Action should be taken before a thing has made its appearance; order should be secured before disorder has begun."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  <strong>On Great Accomplishments</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All difficult things in the world are sure to arise from a previous state in which they were easy, and all great things from one in which they were small. Therefore the sage, while he never does what is great, is able on that account to accomplish the greatest things."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  <strong>On Choosing What Matters</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Or fame or life,
  Which do you hold more dear?
  Or life or wealth,
  To which would you adhere?
  Keep life and lose those other things."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  <strong>On Softness and Strength</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The softest thing in the world dashes against and overcomes the hardest; that which has no (substantial) existence enters where there is no crevice. I know hereby what advantage belongs to doing nothing (with a purpose)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  <strong>On True Mastery</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(Those who) possessed in the highest degree those attributes did nothing (with a purpose), and had no need to do anything. (Those who) possessed them in a lower degree were (always) doing, and had need to be so doing."</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id=" core-teachings-from-book-of-life-"><strong>Core Teachings from Book of Life</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>On Time and Permanence<ul>
<li><strong>Seeking permanence</strong> in relationships, love, or peace means pursuing something within time, which does not belong to the timeless.</li>
<li>One who sees <strong>life totally</strong> is beyond time. Such perception is not bound by past conditioning or future anxieties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On Fear and Death<ul>
<li>The <strong>fear of death</strong> arises as long as there is an observer, an experiencer, or a thinker. When there is no division between the observer and the observed, fear dissolves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On Suffering and Liberation<ul>
<li>Misery can be <strong>cut immediately</strong>, like a surgeon removing an illness. The mind's tendency to delay or analyze suffering only prolongs it.</li>
<li><strong>Sorrow ends within sorrow itself</strong>—escaping sorrow only prolongs it. Full attention and direct awareness dissolve sorrow instantly, without conflict.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On Perception and Awareness<ul>
<li><strong>Perception alone</strong> resolves all problems. Solutions do not lie in escape, avoidance, or intellectualization, but in direct, choiceless awareness.</li>
<li>A truly <strong>attentive mind</strong> is not distracted by the "how" or by seeking an answer—it simply observes without judgment or expectation.</li>
<li><strong>Perception brings energy</strong>, which shatters fear, mental conditioning, and conformity. This energy is transformative, requiring no external validation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On Freedom and the Mind<ul>
<li><strong>True freedom</strong> is not freedom from something but freedom in itself. A mind seeking freedom is never free, as it remains bound by the very desire to escape.</li>
<li>When the <strong>mind perceives without disturbance</strong>, it sees its own depth. This perception is <strong>timeless and cannot be attained through discipline, practice, or method.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The petty mind</strong> is bound by social conditioning, tradition, and fear, whereas true perception liberates and dissolves such limitations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On Innocence and Direct Seeing<ul>
<li><strong>A free mind is an innocent mind</strong>, untainted by experiences, beliefs, or accumulated knowledge. Innocence is not ignorance but the absence of psychological baggage.</li>
<li><strong>The energy of perception</strong> breaks the cycle of habitual thought, fear, and psychological dependency. It is not a process of learning but of direct seeing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Occupation</p>
<h3 id="understanding-self-and-work">Understanding Self and Work</h3>
<p>  Without understanding ourselves, mere occupation leads to frustration and escapism. True relationships require freedom from compulsion and authority. When we see that intelligence cannot be forced, we can create an environment beyond current social constraints.</p>
<h3 id="the-role-of-education">The Role of Education</h3>
<p>  Parents and teachers, fearing disruption to security, guide youth toward safe paths through jobs, marriage, and dogma. They pass on their own limitations through imposed traditions and beliefs.</p>
<h3 id="learning-and-success">Learning and Success</h3>
<p>  Many stop learning after formal education, while others become knowledge-dependent. The pursuit of knowledge for success breeds competition and struggle. When success is our goal, fear of failure follows. This creates conflict, leading to envy and hostility.</p>
<h3 id="conformity-and-growth">Conformity and Growth</h3>
<p>  The young, like their elders, eventually conform to society's expectations. Their initial discontent - the spark of inquiry - fades into the pursuit of security through career and status. Both generations remain bound by desires, as maturity comes through understanding, not age.</p>
<h3 id="wonder-and-change">Wonder and Change</h3>
<p>  We often wait for others to initiate change, remaining passive until outcomes are certain. Yet when we view life solely through survival and profit, we lose its wonder. Children see the world's magic because they're free from these constraints, maintaining nature's cycle of fresh awareness.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sorrow</p>
<h3 id="understanding-and-ending-sorrow">Understanding and Ending Sorrow</h3>
<p>  Is it possible to end sorrow? To do so, we must face loneliness directly - not through time, not by analyzing causes, not by seeking comfort.</p>
<p>  External comforters - priests, psychoanalysts, friends, gurus - may offer temporary relief, but they cannot truly end sorrow. Like a deep wound, we may cover it or try to escape it, but it remains in the dark recesses of our mind.</p>
<p>  Where there is suffering, there can be no love. And without love and compassion, there is no intelligence. If we continue living mechanically as we do now, we contribute nothing to humanity's collective consciousness.</p>
<h3 id="the-path-to-transformation">The Path to Transformation</h3>
<p>  Real change requires a fundamental mutation in our brain's conditioning. This is only possible when we become fully aware of our conditioning and face it directly - our fears, beliefs, dogmas, rituals, pleasures, and sorrows. Without this mutation, we perpetuate mankind's suffering.</p>
<p>  Compassion is born only out of total freedom.</p>

<li><p>Jiddus Best words</p>
<h2 id="key-insights-on-attention-meditation-and-mind">Key Insights on Attention, Meditation and Mind</h2>
<p>  <strong>True Attention</strong>
  Pure attention has no motive or object - it simply is. In this state of complete attention, reality reveals itself naturally.</p>
<p>  <strong>The Path of Meditation</strong>
  When we see how seeking and motives create suffering, we naturally let go. This seeing itself is meditation.</p>
<p>  <strong>Love and Efficiency</strong>
  Actions driven by love are far more effective than those driven by ambition or competition.</p>
<h3 id="freedom-and-understanding">Freedom and Understanding</h3>
<ul>
<li>True happiness comes only with complete freedom</li>
<li>A mind under pressure becomes distorted and cannot function naturally</li>
<li><p>Self-knowledge is essential for wisdom and learning</p>
<h3 id="the-nature-of-silence">The Nature of Silence</h3>
<p>Unlike noise which excludes, silence includes everything. It cannot be contained or resisted. A mind that is naturally still, not forced into stillness, experiences true silence. This brings a tranquility that cannot be manufactured or marketed.</p>
<h3 id="the-art-of-living">The Art of Living</h3>
</li>
<li><p>What's truly meaningful cannot be sought - it must happen naturally</p>
</li>
<li>Trying to control or escape from loneliness only creates fear</li>
<li><p>True surrender cannot be deliberate or demanded</p>
<h3 id="understanding-reality">Understanding Reality</h3>
<p>To see what is, we must move beyond duality and the urge to become something else. The answer lies within the challenge itself, not in trying to escape it.</p>
<h3 id="the-quality-of-awareness">The Quality of Awareness</h3>
<p>When the brain is fully awake, the mind becomes naturally quiet. This brings the highest form of intelligence - an anonymous, whole awareness that is beyond personal and impersonal.</p>
<h3 id="the-nature-of-mind-and-thought">The Nature of Mind and Thought</h3>
<p>The mind constantly seeks achievement and results. But true meditation happens when the seeker ceases, when thought comes to a natural end. Reality emerges not through seeking, but when the seeker is absent.</p>
<h3 id="the-challenge-of-change">The Challenge of Change</h3>
<p>Despite technological progress, humans remain psychologically unchanged - still driven by fear, violence, and envy. This raises fundamental questions about the nature of human transformation.</p>
<h3 id="keys-to-liberation">Keys to Liberation</h3>
</li>
<li><p>Freedom comes from dropping all comparison</p>
</li>
<li>Learning is the art of putting everything in its right place</li>
<li><p>True meditation begins when thought finds its proper role</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.dailyex celsior.com/krishnamurti-on-education/">https://www.dailyexcelsior.com/krishnamurti-on-education/</a></p>
<p>Psychological pressures - economic, social, ethical, religious - distort our actions and thinking. Living without ide als, dealing only with what is, frees us from this pressure.</p>
<h3 id="the-movement-of-thought">The Movement of Thought</h3>
</li>
<li><p>Our sense of self comes from thinking</p>
</li>
<li>When thought stops, total action becomes possible</li>
<li><p>The "me" with its limited mind cannot grasp the immeasurable</p>
<p>Understanding yourself is the beginning of wisdom.</p>
<p>True detachment means flowing with life's changes, not resisting them. You can fully engage with life when you understand its illusory nature.</p>
<h3 id="education-and-learning">Education and Learning</h3>
<p>Modern education focuses on accumulating information, offering escape from self-understanding. This creates confusion and conflict in our relationships with people, things, and ideas.</p>
<p>The means determine the end - they are inseparable.</p>
<p>When the mind controls, it destroys the light of reality. True wisdom begins with self-knowledge.</p>

<h3 id="on-meditation-and-experience">On Meditation and Experience</h3>
<p>The meditator creates separation between thinker and thought. True meditation happens when this division ends. Experience and knowledge alone cannot liberate.</p>
<h3 id="key-teachings">Key Teachings</h3>
</li>
<li><p>Freedom must be immediate - tomorrow breeds confusion</p>
</li>
<li>Fear exists as long as we pursue becoming</li>
<li>Attention arises naturally in an atmosphere of security and love</li>
<li>Life is constant learning, not arrival</li>
<li>A mind that listens fully moves like a river, without self</li>
<li>Practice creates habits, not awareness</li>
<li>You become what you fight against</li>
<li>Accept loneliness as part of yourself</li>
<li><p>Die to small pleasures to free the mind</p>
<h3 id="on-love">On Love</h3>
<p>Love is not thinking or possession. The mind's contents - jealousy, ambition, envy - prevent love. Love is a state of being without "me" or contradictions.</p>
<h3 id="on-learning">On Learning</h3>
</li>
<li><p>True learning means discovering the new</p>
</li>
<li>Comparison breeds fear and prevents learning</li>
<li>Learning is constant movement, not accumulation</li>
<li><p>Knowledge can burden and limit freedom</p>
<h3 id="the-path-to-reality">The Path to Reality</h3>
<p>Reality emerges when the mind empties itself of the past, judgments, and authority. This brings true creativity through self-knowledge. A simple mind, free of accumulation, can understand what's real.</p>
<p>Freedom from conditioning comes through moment-to-moment awareness without judgment. The division between reality and self exists only in the mind that clings to security.</p>

<p>Freud highlighted that repression causes neurosis, but expression alone isn't the cure. Instead, negative emotions should be neutralized and channeled into love, work, and creativity.

<h3 id="the-path-to-emotional-freedom">The Path to Emotional Freedom</h3>
<p>People often avoid inner struggles through distractions, which can turn into addictions. However, letting go of emotions—without resisting, venting, or judging—leads to immediate physiological and emotional benefits, improving health, perception, and overall well-being.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Hate is not conquered by hate. Hate is conquered by love. This is an eternal law."</li>
<li>Insecurity leads to possessiveness and attachment in relationships</li>
<li>Our thoughts about others are often mirrored in their thoughts about us</li>

<li>The Path to Freedom<ul>
<li><strong>Surrender:</strong> Allow feelings to exist without trying to change them</li>

<li><p>Key Quotes</p>
<p>  "Letting go involves being aware of a feeling, letting it come up, staying with it, and letting it run its course without wanting to make it different or do anything about it."</p>
<p>  "Because emotions emit a vibrational energy field, they affect and determine the people who are in our lives. 'Love promotes love,' so that the person who has let go of inner negativity is surrounded by loving thoughts, loving events, loving people, and loving pets."</p>
<p>  "Just being ordinary is an expression of Divinity; the truth of one's real Self can be discovered in the pathway of everyday life. To live with care and kindness is all that is necessary."</p>

<li><p>Core Teachings</p>
<p>  Let go of trying to change and control others.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Silence is the ultimate reality.</strong> It is not the absence of sound but the absence of mental noise. In true silence, all questions dissolve.</li>
<li><strong>You are already free.</strong> The idea that you need to attain something is an illusion. The truth is that you are what you seek.</li>
<li><strong>Reality is beyond concepts.</strong> No philosophy, teaching, or belief system can capture the absolute truth—it can only be experienced.</li>
<li><strong>Nothing ever happened.</strong> The world, your struggles, your story—these are all projections of the mind. Beyond them, you are untouched.</li>
<li><strong>Let go of personal identity.</strong> The ego is a collection of thoughts and memories. It has no real existence, only the power you give it.</li>
<li><strong>No need to change the world.</strong> The world exists in your perception. As your perception changes, so does the world.</li>
<li><strong>The mind will never find peace.</strong> It is in its nature to create problems. True peace is in the recognition of what is beyond the mind.</li>
<li><strong>Stop seeking.</strong> The very act of seeking reinforces the illusion that you are separate from truth. Be still, and it reveals itself.</li>

<h3 id="on-food-and-mind">On Food and Mind</h3>
<p>Eat without thinking of the ego. Then what you eat becomes Bhagavan's prasad.</p>
<h3 id="mental-control">Mental Control</h3>
<p>Just as an elephant's trunk becomes steady when holding an iron chain, the restless mind becomes steady when focused on meditation or invocation.</p>
<p>The mind is like a wandering cow - it takes time and practice to train it to stay in one place. But once it discovers inner happiness, it will not wander outward.</p>
<h3 id="the-nature-of-self">The Nature of Self</h3>
<p>You need not eliminate the wrong "I." Simply find its origin and abide there.</p>
<h3 id="states-of-consciousness">States of Consciousness</h3>
<p>Deep sleep (sushupti) is always present. The difference between an enlightened being (Jnani) and others is their awareness of this state. While both experience ego, the Jnani remains aware of its source.</p>
<h3 id="work-and-action">Work and Action</h3>
<p>The feeling "I work" is what binds you. Ask "Who works?" The work will continue naturally. Make no effort to work or to avoid work - both create bondage.</p>
<h3 id="pain-and-perception">Pain and Perception</h3>
<p>If you remain free from pain, there will be no pain anywhere. Both world and pain are within you. Look within to find freedom from pain.</p>
<h3 id="meditation-and-practice">Meditation and Practice</h3>
<p>Your very nature is meditation. You become conscious of this later, but your nature remains unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="final-teaching">Final Teaching</h3>
<p>Let what comes come, let what goes go, why worry? Like an actor in a drama, play your part free from love or hatred.</p>

          </ul>

          <strong>On Love & Relationships</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Love is what we are — we don't get it from somebody, can't give it to anybody</li>
            <li>Attachment is love polluted by selfishness</li>
            <li>Love can attain what intellect cannot fathom</li>

          <strong>On Surrender & Freedom</strong>

          <h2>Living and Choosing</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="collapsible-content">
          <strong>On Learning & Education</strong>
          <p>True learning happens when the mind is free from accumulation and pressure.</p>
          <p>School should be a place of leisure — not just preparation for a job.</p>

          <strong>On Decision Making & Intuition</strong>
          <p>When intuition speaks, it doesn't reason — it feels right. Stay present without rushing to answers.</p>
          <p>Truth is simple. The mind seeks complexity.</p>

          <strong>On Body and Identity</strong>
          <p>The body operates without the ego. Freedom begins when you stop identifying with form.</p>

          <strong>On Free Will & Surrender</strong>
          <p>Einstein: "We all dance to a mysterious tune played by an invisible piper."</p>
          <p>The absence of free will can feel liberating — let go of control.</p>

          <strong>On Career & Work</strong>
          <p>You are not your job. Jobs come and go — presence is what remains.</p>
          <p>The Universe guides. There is no wrong decision when you're present.</p>

          <strong>On Practical Wisdom</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>If you let go a little, you get a little happiness</li>
            <li>If you let go more, you get more happiness</li>
            <li>If you let go completely, you become free</li>
